# 👋 Hi, I'm Shavy Kashyap

🎓 Master’s student in Aeronautics & Astronautics at the University of Washington  
🔧 Specializing in **Control Systems** | Graduate Student at **RAIN Lab**  
🛰️ Designing feedback-driven control systems for spacecraft orientation, precision pointing, and orbital operations

---

## 🔭 Current Projects

- 🛰️ **Satellite Attitude Control using Quaternions**  
  Designed and implemented a quaternion-based feedback regulator for real-time satellite orientation and dynamic geographic pointing and target tracking using MATLAB/Simulink.


<!--
- 🚁 **Quadcopter Control in Simulink**  
  Modeling and control of quadrotor UAVs with a focus on 6DOF dynamics, feedback control design, and hardware-oriented modeling.
-->

- 📐 **Constrained Control using SDP**  
  Using Semi-Definite Programming(SDP) (a special case of Convex Optimisation) to design attitude control systems with operational constraints such as keep-out (exclusion) zones for sensitive instruments.


- 🛰️ **Drag Augmentation System for Space Debris Mitigation**
  Designed a small satellite with a drag augmentation mechanism and conducted de-orbiting simulations using Ansys STK to validate effectiveness and analyze performance tradeoffs.
